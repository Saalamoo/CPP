# C++ Modules

## About

CPP00 to CPP09 are a series of progressively challenging projects designed to build deep understanding of modern C++ programming. The focus spans object-oriented principles, memory management, inheritance, polymorphism, exception safety, templates, and use of the Standard Template Library (STL), reinforcing both design patterns and low-level implementation skills.

## Module Overview

Each module introduces key concepts in modern C++ development:

- **CPP00 – Basics**  
  Understanding namespaces, classes, member functions, and file I/O

- **CPP01 – Memory and References**  
  Dynamic allocation, references, and pointer basics

- **CPP02 – Orthodox Canonical Form**  
  Constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and assignment operators

- **CPP03 – Inheritance and Polymorphism**  
  Introduction to inheritance and method overriding

- **CPP04 – Abstract Classes and Interfaces**  
  Pure virtual functions and interface design

- **CPP05 – Exceptions**  
  Exception handling and robust error management

- **CPP06 – Casts**  
  Implicit vs explicit casts, `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, etc.

- **CPP07 – Templates**  
  Generic programming with class and function templates

- **CPP08 – Containers**  
  Introduction to STL containers like `vector`, `list`, `map`, and iterators

- **CPP09 – Custom Containers**  
  Creating your own container-like structures and understanding algorithm efficiency

  
Each module emphasizes best practices in clean code, memory safety, and performance-aware design—aligned with modern C++ standards.
